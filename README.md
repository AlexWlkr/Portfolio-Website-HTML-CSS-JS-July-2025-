# Alexandria Walker – Frontend Developer Portfolio

Welcome! This is the codebase for my portfolio site — a space to showcase the projects I’ve built while transitioning into frontend development, and a reflection of what I value: thoughtful design, real-world impact, and accessible tech.

### About Me

I’m Alexandria Walker — a digital strategist turned frontend developer with a master’s in clinical social work. For the past several years, I’ve worked on social impact campaigns focused on financial literacy, career access, mental health, and suicide prevention.

Now I’m retraining in tech through Skillcrush’s frontend development program. I’m especially interested in projects that live at the intersection of technology, community, and care — tools that make life easier, clearer, or more human.

### Tech Stack

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript (Vanilla + React)
- Git + GitHub for version control
- APIs (REST, TMDB)
- Chart.js
- Accessibility-first design practices
- Responsive layouts + flexbox/grid

### Featured Projects

- **Untangled** – A decision-making support app for users with ADHD/anxiety  
- **Until Then** – A calming countdown timer and reflection journal  
- **Mental Health Dashboard** – A filterable tool for finding local programs

### Goals

I’m currently seeking a junior frontend developer role on a mission-driven team. I’d love to join projects where accessibility, emotional intelligence, and community outcomes are prioritized alongside clean code and good UX.

Let’s build something that makes a difference.
